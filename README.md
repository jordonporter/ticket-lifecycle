<h2>Lifecycle Stages</h2>
• Karen, who is an end user, has submitted a ticket reporting a complete outage in mobile banking services. She categorizes this issue as a "Business Critical Outage" from the menu. In the previous tutorial, I demonstrated how to create help topics, such as "Business Critical Outage," to better organize incoming tickets.

• In the agent panel, agents have access to real-time tickets. Queue managers are responsible for allocating high-priority tickets to the relevant agents and managing SLAs or reassigning tickets to different departments when necessary. Agents, like Jane Doe, can provide updates on the tickets they are handling to communicate their progress in resolving the issues.

• In this instance, we are setting the ticket's priority to "Emergency" because of its critical impact on business operations. We have also adjusted the SLA plan and assigned the ticket to a top-level technician. In certain ticketing systems, customers may have the option to define their own SLA plans. Jane Doe, the designated agent, has responded to the ticket, indicating that both she and the system administration team are actively addressing the problem.

<p>
• After resolving issues, the agent has the option to close the ticket. Closed tickets are then moved from the queue to a separate tab designated for completed tickets. Within this tab, you can view the date and time when the tickets were resolved, along with the agent responsible for closing them.
